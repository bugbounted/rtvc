**The UI of this app is very crude as it was thrown together in one afternoon.**

## Requirements
- A browser that supports the Web Speech API. Chrome is recommended
- A subscription to ElevenLabs. Traditionally this is $5/month but they currently have an offer for $1 for your first month.
- If you plan to play the audio through a microphone, I use VoiceMeeter to route my desktop audio to a virtual mic output.

# Running
